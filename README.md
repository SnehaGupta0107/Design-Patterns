Design Patterns are proven solutions to common problems that developers face while designing software systems. They provide a standardized way to solve recurring issues, making code more flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain.

The concept of design patterns was popularized by the "Gang of Four" (GoF) in their book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software. They categorized patterns into three main types:

Creational Patterns: Deal with object creation mechanisms, improving flexibility and reuse of existing code.
Structural Patterns: Focus on composing classes and objects to form larger structures.
Behavioral Patterns: Concerned with communication between objects and managing complex interactions.
